      CHAPTER I. <br />
      Down the Rabbit-Hole.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <b>Alice</b> was beginning to get very tired of sitting
      <mark>by her sister on the bank,</mark> and of having nothing to do: once
      or twice she had peeped into the book her <mark>sister was reading,</mark>
      but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a
      book,” thought Alice “without pictures or conversations?”
    </p>
    <p>
      <u
        >So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
        hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid),</u
      >
      <s
        >the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of
        getting up and picking the daisies,</s
      >
      when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

        There was nothing so very
        <!--remarkable in that-->; nor did Alice think it so very much out of
        the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be
        late!” (when she thought it
        <!-- over -->
        afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this,
        but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit
        actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and
        then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her
        mind that she had never before seen a
        <!-- rabbit -->
        with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and
        burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and
        fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole
        under the hedge.</i
